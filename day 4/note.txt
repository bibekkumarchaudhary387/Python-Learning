a. The for loop use this when you know how many times you want to repeat somthing. We often use it with range()

range(start, start) - stop is not included!
This prints 1, 2, 3, 4 (It stops before 5)
for number in range(1, 5):
    print(number)

b. The while loop use this when you want to loop as long as a condition is True.

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Loading...")
    count += 1 #crucial! if you forget this, the loop runs FOREVER (Infinite loop)
