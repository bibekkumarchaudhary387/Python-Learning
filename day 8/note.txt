Dictioaries: (Key Value Pairs)

Goal: Store data like professional. Lists ([]) are great for ordered items, but they are bad for lebelled data. If you have a user profile, you don't want to remember that index 0 is the name and index 1 is the email. You want to lebel them.

The Dictioaries {}
-->A dictioaries is a collection of keys and values.
 key: The label (likes word in book)
 value: The data (likes the definition)

 Syntax
    key on the left: value on the right

    user = {
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": 25,
        "is_student": True
    }

    Accessing data (use the key, not a number)
    print(user["name"]) --> print Alex
    print(user["age]) --> print 25

    Modifying Dictioaries
    1. Changing a value
    user["age"] = 26

    2. Adding a new key - value Pairs
    user["city"] = "kathmandu"

    3. Checking if a key exists
    if "email" in user:
        print(user["email"])
    else:
        print("No email found")
