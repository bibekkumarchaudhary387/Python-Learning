List (Storing  multiple items)

Goal: Move beyong single variable up until now if you wanted to store 5 names, you needed name1, name2, name3..., this us messy. Today, we use list to store them all in one place.

A list []
--> A list is an ordered collection of items you can chaneg it (add/remove items) anytime.

#A list of fruits
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

#python counts from 0
print(fruits[0]) #print "Apple"
print(fruits[1]) #print "Banana"
print(fruits[-1]) #print "cherry" (negative indexing)

Modifying the list:
--> Add item: fruits.append("Orange") --> add to the end
--> Remove item: fruits.pop() --> remove the last one
--> Insert item: fruits: fruits.insert(1, "Mango") --> puts mango at index 1

Tuple
--> A tuple is a "Locked list", once you created it, you cannot change it. Use this for data that shouldn't change (like coordinates or drag of the web)

coordinates = (10,20)
#coordinates[0] = 15 <-- ERROR! you can't change tuple
