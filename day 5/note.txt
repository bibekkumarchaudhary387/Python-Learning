Functions (The "DRY" Principle)

Today goal: Stop writing the same code twice. DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

What is functions?
A function is a block of code that only runs when you call it. Think of it like a "Recipe". You write the recipe once, but you can cook the meal as many times as you want.

The syntax:
--> def : tells python you are making a function
--> return : sends the answer back to the main program

1. Defining the function (The recipe)
    def my_greeting(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

2. Calling the function (cooking)
    my_greeting("Alice")
    my_greeting("Bob")

Return vs. Print (crucial concept)
--> print : just shows text on the screen. The computer "forgots" the value immediatly
--> return : gives the value back to the code so you can store it in a variable

    def add_numbers(a, b):
        return a + 
    
    result = add_numbers(5, 10): #request now holds 15
    print(result)
